## About the Open Data Initiative
"We operate best, when we are operating in the open. We make better decisions and we build trust that way. And trust is certainly the foundation that allows us to work on behalf of the public. Without that trust we lose legitimacy."

## The Open Data Portal
 The City of Austin’s open data portal provides access to data and information about your city government. We encourage the use of public data to spark innovation, promote public collaboration, increase government transparency, and inform decision making. <a href="https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us">Socrata</a> is the software company that powers the open data portal.

## The Open Data Initiative History
On December 11th, 2011, the Austin City Council passed  <a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Law/Council_Portal_Page/Resolution_Open_Government_Directive_2011.pdf">Resolution No. 20111208-074 </a>, commonly known as the Open Data Ordinance. It mandated that the following issues be addressed by the City of Austin:
- Open Data rules and standards
- Open Source Platforms guidelines
- Mobile applications strategies to promote citizen engagement and innovation
- Social media standards.

It put forth four recommend on:
1. Develop an Open Government Directive with administrative guidelines on steps to achieve transparency, efficiency, and collaboration
2. Identify funding requirements and an implementation  timeline for the various elements of the recommends ons
3. Participate in a national dialogue on standards for Open Data Initiatives at the municipal level
4. Report bi-monthly to the Council Emerging Technology and Telecommunications Committee

Two years later, on August 26, 2013, an Open Government Direct was published, reiterating a commitment to Open Government, which outlined specific steps for the City Departments:
- It called for an Open Data Catalog within 60 days
- Identification and publication of high value datasets within 75 days
- A mechanism for public feedback and licensing among other objectives
- It also required the City to create an Open Government Plan with 120 days to outline how each department would develop transparency, public Participation, and collaboration

The plan laid out guidelines for the process of utilizing accessible and emerging  technology and tools; along with guidelines and a timeline for creating an enabling policy framework for Open Government.

On April 8, 2015, Marc Ott, the City Manager at the time published another Directive, the City of Austin Open Data Initiative 2.0. The directive set a  timeline for 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days, and ongoing, in “order to change how government works, provide more effective services, drive data-informed decision-making, and promote economic development opportunities, all departments and offices within the City of Austin are required to take the following steps to Participate in the City’s Open Data Initiative 2.0 that will begin with the issuance of this memorandum.”

Within 30 days the Initiative called for an Identification on of Open Liaisons for each department and an inventory of known data managed and maintained by each department. Within 60 days the directive called for liaisons and department directors to participate in workshops, public outreach to deter- mine interest areas and departmental plans and schedules for publishing to the Open Data Portal. With- in 90 days the directive set a goal to publish at least three datasets per department, create plans for each Department over the next 12 months, and create a scorecard system to determine Participation.
